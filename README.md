# DataVisulization_UsingGui

# INTRODUCTION

 Data visualization is a graphic representation that expresses the significance of data. It reveals insights 
and patterns that are not immediately visible in the raw data. It is an art through which information, 
numbers, and measurements can be made more understandable. There are many data visualization tools 
like Tableau, Sisense, Plotly, Fusion Charts, High charts, Data wrappers, and QlikView.
 The main goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and effectively through 
graphical means. It doesnâ€™t mean that data visualization needs to look boring to be functional or 
extremely sophisticated to look beautiful. EDA: -Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method of 
analyzing and investigating the data sets to summarize their main characteristic.
 Our system is constructed on the concept of Data Visualization and Machine Learning, for which 
Python 3.x language lays the foundation for programming for the system as it is widely used in the field 
of Data Science and also supports feature rich libraries for developing Graphic User Interfaces which 
makes is best fit for project development. The System is totally focused on making the tedious process 
of data visualization and building up a machine learning model through means of graphic user interfaces 
to make the processing easy and avoid programming for user and it also provides friendly environment 
for the user.
 Do not need to import other data visualization libraries in addition to Pandas for such tasks. This 
project is related to data visualization and machine learning. Machine learning is a part of artificial 3 
intelligence that combines data with statistical tools to predict an output that can be used to make 
actionable insights. It is closely related to data mining and Bayesian predictive modeling. The machine 
receives data as input and uses an algorithm to formulate answers.
